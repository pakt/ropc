% Set up code environment, in which most of the common special characters
% appearing in code are treated verbatim, namely: _ # & ^ $ ~ @ " %
%  *** JAR NEEDED $ AND _ IN SOME CODE ***

% Note: \ { } are still enabled so that macros can be called in this
% environment.  Use \\, \{ and \} to use these characters verbatim
% in this environment.

% Note: this environment allows no breaking of lines whatsoever; not
% at spaces or hypens.  To arrange for a break use the standard \- macro,
% or the \= macro which breaks, but inserts nothing.  This is useful,
% for example for allowing hypenated identifiers to be broken, e.g.
% FOO-\=BAR.
